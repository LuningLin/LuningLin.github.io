### High-Resolution DOA Estimation for Sparse Arrays in Aquatic Environments
*Funded by: National Defence Technology Innovation Center*
*Duration: Jan. 2025 - Dec. 2025*
- **Description:** This project focuses on the theory and technology of underdetermined high-resolution Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation using co-prime sparse arrays in underwater scenarios.
- **My Contribution:** As a key student researcher, I investigated the rank-deficiency problem of the virtual-domain covariance matrix caused by multipath propagation and designed robust super-resolution algorithms to improve the accuracy and resolution of underwater target DOA estimation.

### High-Accuracy Sensing of Low-Altitude UAVs in Urban Areas based on 5G/B5G Signals
*Funded by: National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)*
*Duration: Jan. 2022 - Dec. 2025*
- **Description:** This project aims to achieve high-accuracy localization and sensing of low-altitude UAVs by repurposing existing 5G network infrastructure.
- **My Contribution:** As a student lead for the sub-project on "High-Accuracy Localization and Fusion-based Identification," I proposed a motion-target-localization-assisted communication precoding scheme to address the challenge of limited spectral efficiency in high-dynamics environments (published in IEEE ICASSP). I Developed a wide-area passive UAV detection algorithm based on communication signal spectrum perturbation analysis, which won an award at a student competition.

### Indoor-Outdoor Fused Positioning Technology for Mobile Networks
*Funded by: China Mobile (Zhejiang) Big Data Center*
*Duration: May 2020 - Aug. 2021*
- **Description:** This project aimed to overcome the heavy burden of on-site data collection by building a radio-frequency fingerprinting database through electromagnetic simulation based on dominant path models.
- **My Contribution:** I proposed a novel method for constructing an integrated indoor-outdoor electromagnetic simulation fingerprint database, which led to an authorized Chinese invention patent.
